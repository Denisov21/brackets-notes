## Brackets Notes Extension

Extension for [Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets) that allows the user to easily add and manage notes, with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) support.\*

**<ins>IMPORTANT:</ins>** After adding Markdown support, it was a little difficult to also support the old format, so there is a possibility that your already saved notes will not work properly with the new version.
If you have a previous version installed (eg. 0.1.0, 0.1.1, 0.1.2), it is recommended to:

1. Backup your saved notes.
2. Delete them.
3. Proceed to the update.
4. Add your notes with Markdown syntax.

_**For anayone who prefers the older version of the extension, this can be found [here](http://https://github.com/georapbox/brackets-notes-outdated).**_

\* This small extension was firstly developed for my personal projects' needs but I thought I should share for anyone that might find it useful.

**Tested with Brackets Sprint >=37**
